## As a developer

Since code is the best and most complete documentation we decided to provide you with some examples. In the folder ```src/Buddy.Clash.DefaultSelectors``` you will find the source code for the ```IActionSelector``` implementations that are part of the default download.

Feel free to base your ```IActionSelector``` on any of these.
