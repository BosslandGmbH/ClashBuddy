# Device setup

Due to advanced memory manipulation technology, ClashBuddy requires a device that is setup according to some specifications. This device could either be an emulator or a mobile device.
Since manipulating memory is a security related task ClashBuddy will require root access on your device. For additional information pleas see the according section.

## Device

Your device needs to be rooted. We had good success running AICP but basically every rom should work. On your device enable USB Debugging.

## Emulator

Depending on the emulator you're using there might be manual steps required for it to show up in Android Debug Brdige. Also make sure the emulator is rooted.
