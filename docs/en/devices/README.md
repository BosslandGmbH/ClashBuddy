# Device setup

Due to advanced memory manipulation technology, ClashBuddy requires a device that is setup according to some specifications. This device could either be an emulator or a mobile device.
Since manipulating memory is a security related task ClashBuddy will require root access on your device. For additional information pleas see the according section.

## Specific Devices

* [MEmu](./memu.md)
* [Bluestacks 3](./bluestacks-3.md)

## General

When your device or emulator is not listed above you still might have success. Just make sure your device fullfills the requirements.

### Device

Your device needs to be rooted. We had good success running AICP but basically every rom should work. On your device enable USB Debugging.

### Emulator

Depending on the emulator you're using there might be manual steps required for it to show up in Android Debug Brdige. Also make sure the emulator is rooted.
